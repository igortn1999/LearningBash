the Path system variable ($PATH) is stored in the ~/.profile file. It contains (amongst others) informations on where to find the executable files.
By adding a folder with scripts do the path variable, you make it possible to call them from anywhere

Do this by simply adding the following line to the .profile file:
export PATH=$PATH:<path to folder>
